                    <h4>Adulthood</h4>
            <p>
                "I'm going away Mom, and i might never see you again..."That is exactly what i told my mom before leaving France 15 years ago, 
                I am Sonia C. Mokpeme, 35years old, i moved from Paris to Manchester in 2004, left my family and comfort zone to start a new life  and switch
                 from a teenage spoilt little girl to become an adult as i just turned 21 
                then, i could barely speak english, and never knew the reality of life like paying rent and bills but my confidence and strive was up the roof which got me  my first serious job,doing 
                Administration for Royal Bank of Scotland's Group in Spinningfields Manchester for over 5 years, then went on working for 
                Barclays Corporate Group for 4 years while raising my first daughter who is now
                9 years old and my second daughter is 18 months old which is why i am not working
                at the moment so i can look after her. 
                As a single mother i find myself to be more concerned about the children, the house, my hair etc than educating myself unfortunately, however 
                I am reading Becoming Michelle Obama at the moment, so i can pick her brain on her work ethic as i think she is 
                extremely inspiring and a powerful woman, plus i think she does look like me.

            <h4>What made me interested in Joining Code Nation </h4>

            <p>I was interested in joining Code Nation to learn more about computering ( which is my weakest point), i happened to find a link about the course on instagram and automatically got drawn into it,
                plus i thought the coding course can literally change my entire career path which is a great thing for my daughters and i,
                i was never capable to build a website nor an App, but thanks to Code Nation i now have more knowledge 
                and hoping to get an Apprenticeship so i can start the Master course and progress even more in the department and hopefully get a job at the end.
            </p>
            <h3 >
                <p class="text" id="text" >My interests in technology and coding</p>
            </h3>
            <ul>Having no background in IT, i thought getting on this course was helpful and useful to my day to day life i.e simple thing using my Iphone 7</ul>
            <ul>Helping my daughter to do online researches for her homework</ul>
            <ul>Downloading Apps on my phone like Instagram , Snapchat, basically most social media Apps 
                which are my favourite things to do as i love to blog and post pictures, most importantly my bank accounts quick access...</ul>
<h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
    </h3>
    <p>Communication: Many organizations take electronic mail ”email” as a basic form of communication among employees, 
        customers, business partners and suppliers. The simplicity of electronic mail ”email” makes it easier 
        and faster to exchange information across departments in an organization. The all process saves time and money. 
        However, more emerging forms of communications have surfaced and they also make communication easier. 
        These include video conferencing systems, Voice over internet telephones ‘‘VIOP’’, 
        live text and video chat services like ”SKYPE” and smart-phones.
        </p>
        <p>Information technology is the technology used to store, manipulate, distribute or create information.  
            All these can be summed up easily – It’s having knowledge, and knowledge comes from having information. 
            Gaining knowledge through information is the role of ‘’information technology’’ IT in today’s informed world.

                IT is a set of tools that can help provide the right people with the right information at the right time.  
                Though IT is not a solution to every thing, for IT to work, people must learn how to use it. 
                So you can not assume that IT will work for you to share information across the organization when people 
                in the organization don’t know how to use it.
                </p>

                <h3>What causes digital projects to fail and why?</h3>

                <p>Investing in shiny objects, not customer value. Projects that fail are so often a result of 
                    investing in a cool gadget, but not investing in business or customer value. For instance, 
                    say gea CEO asks a digital project manager to deploy a CRM. ... Because it didn't start with a 
                    business requirement or customer need. And other things like Lack of interest from the Management, Cost-cutting Approaches,
                 Lack of proper planning, failure to manage Scope Creep, 
                 Overly-optmistic Project Schedule, Overstaffing of Projects, Poor Communication  </p>

                 <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>

                 <p>    <h4>Set your purpose and goals.</h4> 
                     <ul>

                    <li>What is the purpose of your website? Is it to gain publicity for your business? To sell your inventory? 
                         To rally support behind a cause? It’s important to identify your website’s purpose, as well as your target audience. 
                         You should also define your goals. Set measurable, specific goals for your website that are in line with your marketing goals. 
                         An analytics tool like Google Analytics will allow you to monitor your website’s performance over time.</li>
                       
                         <h4>Create Trello.</h4> 
                         
                         <li>Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, 
                         Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, 
                         and where something is in a process.</li>
                        
                        <h4>Create a content strategy.</h4> 

                        <li>What kind of content will you be displaying on your website? Content is basically anything that gives your visitors information. 
                        It can include, but is not limited to:
                        Blog posts
                        Documents
                        Video
                        Pictures (such as in a gallery)
                        Slideshows
                        Embedded social media feeds (such as your Twitter stream or Facebook page updates)</li>
                        
                         <h4>Structure your website.</h4> 
                        
                        <li>Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one. 
                        Most websites have an About and Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.</li>

                    
                        <h4>Start designing.</h4> 

                        <li>The importance of good web design can’t be stressed enough. Good website design includes 
                        both usability and aesthetics. An ugly website will drive away visitors, as will a website that’s difficult to 
                        navigate. Keep in mind some basic concepts of usability as you go:

                        Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find. Research shows that most users expect website navigation to be vertical and centered at the top of the page.
                        Use an easy-to-read font for blocks of text. Choose a background color and text color that contrast well (Hint: No red text on a hot pink background).
                        Make sure your site fits the screen. Use responsive design (or an equally effective approach) to make your website one that adapts to all screen sizes.
                        Keep your website light so that it loads quickly.
                        Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the page.
                        Keep styles and colors consistent across the website.
                        Make copy clear and concise, and put important information and features (e.g., your newsletter sign-up form) above the fold.
                        Make notes about what to include in the style sheet as you design, as you want to keep style and function separate. This is important, not only to comply with web standards, but to make it easier to change something in the future if you need to.
                        You should also design with the future in mind. For instance, your website may only have a few blog posts now, 
                        but what about when you have two hundred?</li>

                         <h4>Test it out.</h4> 

                                

                        <li>Testing is important for getting out bugs out and catching details that you might have missed initially.
                         Make sure your website shows up the way you want it to in all browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, 
                         and mobile web browsers like Safari and Opera Mini. Test it on your cell phone, your tablet, and your colleague’s cell phones
                         and tablets too. You want your site to have a consistent appearance no matter what screen it shows up on. 
                          Make sure all of the links work, that the images are properly sized, 
                          and that you’ve replaced all of the placeholders with actual content. 
                        See to it that all of the forms and other input fields are working.</li>
                        
                        <h4>Maintain your site.</h4> 


                        <li>Maintenance is very important. Monitor your analytics software to see how your website is performing with the public. 
                        Keep an eye on metrics like your number of unique visitors, bounce rate, and which pages are most popular on your website. 
                        You might find that certain metrics are more useful to you than others, but that 
                        is information you’ll find out over time.</li></ul>

                    
                    </p>
                    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h3>

                    <p>As with most aspects of business, digital projects rarely happen under ideal circumstances. 
                    They can require a broad convergence of people, systems and data. 
                    Risk mitigation is the term used for having a plan to address risk in a project. 
                    All projects, regardless of the size or nature of the project, should include risk mitigation during the planning process.
                    By investing time upfront to address risks head-on, you’ll be better prepared to turn unexpected events into new opportunities, 
                     instead of spending your days putting out fires.
</p>
                    <h3>1.5 Describe how would you go about selecting and using IT System Software </h3>

                    <ul>I would start by organizing the project by creating A Trelo Board</ul>
                    <ul>I would define the business needs by Creating The Portfolio/Website required;</ul>
                    <ul>Then i would use thye appropriate IT System like Trello Board, Slack, Visual Code, Google, etc </ul>

                    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>

                    <P>My chosen IT are Slack To get Email, messages, instructions and directions from my teacher </P>
                    <p>Trello to create and organise my project and see the Progress done on it </p>
                    <p>Visual Code is to editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. 
                        Visual Studio Code is free and easy to use </p>

                    <h3>1.7 Describe Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
                
                <p>There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, 
                    including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file 
                    can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. 
                    You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
                    Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. 
                    You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. 
                    Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.</p>

<h2>Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>

<p> My website is made of One page, containing my Portfolio 
    which is about my background with my picture, my journey into IT, my reasons of joining Code Nation 
    and few Assignments on the purpose of IT in Modern business </p>

<h2> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting website</h3>

<p> Copyright is the exclusive and assignable legal right, 
    given to the originator for a fixed number of years, to print, publish, 
    perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material..
    And the other Constraints affecting Website are 

    <li>Physical Constraints , which are physical objects , 
    they can be actual or virtual, that 
restrict the user's actions on the site, there are 3 types of physical constraints Paths, Axes, Barriers </li>

    <li>Psychological Constraints These are constraints which control the way the user perceives their environment. 
        There are three methods of implementing psychological constraints; 
        symbols, conventions, and mapping</li> 

        <li>Using Constrtaints Limiting the user in what they can do may seem backward at first. 
            However you will soon realise by limiting what users can do you can concentrate on  perfecting 
            the actions which they can do. By understanding and implementing constraints when designing and building your website will help users navigate and use your website 
            with minimal errors, thus creating a more satisfactory user experience.</li>
    </p>
 
    <h2> Describing access issues that need taking into account -

    <h2>Review</h2>

    <h4>  Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – 
        in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used</h4>

    <ul> My Webpage looks too content with words (which might be a bit exhausting reading)</ul>
    <ul>Lacks of Animations and maybe some entertaining background</ul>
    <ul>Lacks of Buttons to open up differents pages, links and index</ul>  
<p> I used different tools to complete my project, they were all usefull one another </p>
    <ul>The IT Tools used are Trello (Kanban Style)</ul>
    <ul>Visual Studio Code</ul> 
    <ul>Slack</ul>
    <ul>Git hub</ul>

    <h4> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h4>

    The tools that i have used were appropriate and very necessary for my project

    <h4> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project </h4>

 <p>The strenghts of my project
    
    <ul>I could write a bit about my background in my Portfolio with my picture on it</ul>
    <ul>I have got to use all the tools that i have learned during the 3 weeks course</ul> 
    <ul>I have answered all the questions from the assignments and 
    I could design it exactly the way i wanted </ul></p>

    <p>The weakness are 
        <ul>I could have made the project less wordly</ul>
        <ul>looks too compressed</ul> 
        <ul>doesnt have any animation</ul>
        plus i don't have any buttons to link up to different pages 
        
    </p>
<h4>  Describe further improvements you can make to your project

<p> To improve my project i will need to add more animation, 
    Make it on different pages instead of all on one ( Make it more spacious) 
     Also make it more accessible for the disabled people </p>

    <ul>Google Browser</ul>
